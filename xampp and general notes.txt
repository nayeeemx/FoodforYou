****DATABASE****
--->The connectivity part starts at add-admin below using $post (method)
--->config file because the php code for connecting database is done everytime we are performing some content upload,
    saving in new file so can be easily changed when password or db is changes
--->Adding constant file in menu cause we can apply it in all of the other files 

<?php include('../config/constants.php');?>****
Reason for the ..   cause we are inside a particular folder and we have to get out of that folder so we are using .. 


passing value through form is post method 
passing the value usign url is get method

while getting the password and trying to match the the username make sure to decrypt the encrypted password	

In case of radio to get the preexisting value use "checked";

$server means php variables 

******GLITCH TO NOTE*********
Food menu and category menu small photo sizes causes unordered list
